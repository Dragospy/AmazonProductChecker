# Amazon Product Finder
- Creator: Dragospy (aka W4TCH3R)

# Why did I make this?
Well, I realised my name is Dragos.py, and I had no python projects on here.

So I thought, what is something that really annoys me? And browsing amazon and comparing products on there was more or less top of the list.
Therefore, I made<sup>*</sup> this.

# Dependencies & Installation
This was built using Python 3.12.8, but it should work with newer versions aswell. So use version 3.12.8 and up

I recommend making a virtual environment when using this, though it is not necessary.

1. Download the latest release of the **Amazon Product Search** from GitHub

2. There are only 3 dependecies so you can install them like this:
```
pip install bs4
pip install selenium
pip install undetected_chromedriver
pip install setuptools
```

**Using pip is not necessary, just the easiest way in my opinion**


# How to use it
Simply run the following in your terminal (Inside the directory with the main.py file in it)
```
python main.py
```

## Search
If you choose to search for a product, then you will get asked what you want to search for.
Once you type that in, you will then get asked how you would like your items to be sorted.

## Compare
working on this still...




*Refers to the fact that its still in the works...
